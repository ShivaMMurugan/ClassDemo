git commit -m "Test" > commits a file that can be moved to github anytime. Every commit generates a random hash value also known as "commit id"
git log > Gives the commit id of the last commit along with total commit history.
git push > Moves your changes to remote repo.
git pull > Refreshes remote repo with your local repo


BRANCHING:

After creating a branch in github, ex "develop" this will set upstream with main branch by default.

git pull to get a branch from remote to your local machine

To cut a branch from develop > git checkout -b develop remotes/origin/develop

Type git branch to ensure you are actually in develop

create a new file in develop branch and add few lines of code and commit.

Then push your changes to remote repo under develop branch.

Cherry-pick:

Type git log in develop branch and copy the commit id of the recent commit

move to main branch by issuing git checkout main

cherry-pick your commit by issuing git cherry-pick "commit id you copied"

git push 

This will cherry-pick the change to main branch.
